# projet-automate-P2

Un petit projet sympa entre amis.

## What you need to do to run the program

- Install pygame with the following `pip install pygame` because our program is using a graphic interface !
- Run the main.py file
- Have fun!

## How to use the program

In the menu, you have already multiple choice :

- You can create a blank canvas, and start creating your own automate
- You can load an automate from the one that were given to us for this project
- You can load an automate from a specific file (Warning : It's case sensitive and it's not a file explorer...)
- You can exit (Peronnaly, I would not go for this option...)

---

While in the edit mode, you can add

- Add a node by right clicking in an empty space
- Move a node by left clicking and dragging the node
- Modify a transition by clicking on the arrow, and then click on the up or down key on your keyboard to change the letter
- Add a transition between 2 nodes by left clicking on a node and dragging the link to another node (or himself)
- Delete a node/link by clicking on it and the Suppr

---

There is a lot of functionnality to explore, such as:

- Standardize
- Determine
- Complete
- Minimize
- Complement

Some of those function requires a determinisation or/and a completion to work, but you'll be notif in those case !

---

You can also check if a word is recognize by an automate by clicking on the Check Word button

---

Finally, you can re-create a blank automate, load an automate or save your current work.
When you save, 2 files will be created : `NameOfYourAutomate.txt` and `NameOfYourAutomate.data`
Please, do not modify the 2 files, because one is here to know the states/nodes, and the other one is used to have the position of the nodes !!!!

## I think this is it, so have fun !
