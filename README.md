## About OH ! Tomate

**OH ! Tomate** is a project as part of the Automate module in second year of preparatory class in Efrei. The point of this app is to create, modify and apply algorithms to what is called an automate. The first version of this app was buit using python and the pygame library within a week. We are currently working on a more stable version before building a better one directly for the web.
